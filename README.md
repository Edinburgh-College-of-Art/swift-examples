# swift-examples
a few examples of swift programming for the iOS beginner

## Goals
The main goal of this repository is to provide a series of working swift examples that demonstrate how to achieve relatively simplistic apps. The target audience is any UX designer wishing to learn a little more about programming in swift. Hopefully, this code will help bring designers ideas over from a digital product design environment and onto a device as an app.
